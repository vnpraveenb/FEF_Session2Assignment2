                 HTML5 is basically about extending HTML/XHTML with new more semantically rich elements, deprecating attributes, introducing new attributes and altering how some element and attributes are allowed to be used. <br><br>

                 It is not a reformulation of previous versions of the language. It includes all valid elements from both HTML4 and XHTML 1.0. Furthermore, it&apos;s been designed with some principles in mind to ensure it works on just about every platform, is compatible with older browsers, and handles errors gracefully. A summary of the design principles that guided the creation of HTML5 can be found on the W3C&apos;s HTML Design Principles page. <br><br>
                 
                 First and foremost, HTML5 includes redefinitions of existing markup elements in addition to new elements that allow web designers to be more expressive in describing the content of their pages. Why litter your page with div elements when you can use article, section, header, footer, and so on? <br><br>
                 
                 The term &quot;HTML5&quot; has also been used to refer to a number of other new technologies and APIs. Some of these include drawing with the canvas element, offline storage, the new video and audio elements, drag-and-drop functionality, Microdata, and embedded fonts. <br><br>

            <h2> CSS3 </h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                CSS is a style language that describes how HTML markup is presented to the user. CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. <br><br>

                CSS3 contains just about everything that&apos;s included in CSS2.1, the previous version of the spec. It also adds new features to help developers solve a number of presentation related problems without resorting to scripting plugins or extra images.<br><br>

                New features in CSS3 include support for additional selectors, drop shadows, rounded corners, updated layout features, animation, transparency, and much more. <br><br>

                CSS3 is distinct from HTML5. In this publication, we&apos;ll be using the term CSS3 to refer to the current level of the CSS specification, with a particular focus on what&apos;s been added since CSS2.1. Thus, CSS3 is separate from HTML5 and its related APIs. <br><br>

                One final point should be made here regarding CSS and the current &quot;version 3&quot; label. Although this does seem to imply that there will one day be a  &quot;CSS4&quot;,Tab Atkins, a member of the CSS Working Group, has noted that there are no plans for it. Instead, as he explains, the specification has been divided into separate modules, each with its own version number. So you might see something like  &quot;CSS Color Module Level 4 &quot; but that does not refer to  &quot;CSS4. &quot; No matter what level an individual module is at, it will still technically be under the umbrella of  &quot;CSS3, &quot; or better yet, simply  &quot;CSS. &quot; For the purposes of this book, we &apos;ll still refer to it as  &quot;CSS3, &quot; but just understand that this is likely to be the last version number for the language as a whole. <br><br>

                    JavaScript ( &quot;JS &quot; for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.<br><br>
                   
                    JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks. With more experience, you&apos;ll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! <br><br>
                    
                    JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. <br><br>
